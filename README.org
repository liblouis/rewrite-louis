* rewrite-louis

An experimental parser for liblouis tables based on [[https://github.com/engelberg/instaparse][instaparse]]. Given
a liblouis table the parser returns plain old Clojure data. This can
be used for example to rewrite the table into any other format.

** Usage

#+begin_src clojure
   (require '[instaparse.core :as insta])
   (def louis-parser (insta/parser (clojure.java.io/resource "louis.bnf")))
   (louis-parser (slurp "~/src/liblouis/tables/ar-ar-comp8.utb"))
#+end_src

which will return

#+begin_src clojure
  [:table
   [:comment "afr#1#Afrikaans Uncontracted#za#Afrikaans onverkort"]
   ,,,
   [:comment " <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>."]
   [:include "en-ueb-g1.ctb"]]
#+end_src

** Acknowledgements

A lot of the [[https://github.com/liblouis/rewrite-louis/blob/main/resources/louis.bnf][EBNF grammar]] was basically re-used from [[https://github.com/liblouis/louis-parser][louis-parser]] and
its liblouis table grammar definition in the form of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing_expression_grammar][Parsing
expression grammar]].
